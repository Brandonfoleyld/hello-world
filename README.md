  Hello, my name is Brandon, i own this site. I made the webpage for a it 9 class. I use it as a portfolio.


</p>
<p>
  I would like to talk about an issue that concerns the future. As we know technology is getting more and more advanced as we speak. Eventually robots will be taking over a lot of our jobs. For example, a normal human worker at a grocery store, will do a good job at what he does, but he needs a paycheck, he can take sick days,or he will need to move on in a few years. However, a robot will do the job perfectly, never need pay, never gets sick, and will last for several years. But, their is a problem, if robots take over all the low to medium skill jobs, there will be no employment for the masses, and if that happens, then people will not have any money, and the robots will lose their jobs because no one will have money to pay for what they make or do. So we need to balance having more efficiency, and having jobs for the masses.
